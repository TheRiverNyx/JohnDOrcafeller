## My Process
I mainly used ZBrush for everything. Even the Top Hat. My Remeshing process mainly consisted me using ZRemesher and 
guides until I got the desired Topology that I wanted. I also used and applied Dynamic Subdivision to my model  before 
I ZRemeshed. Maya is what I will be using to UV map. I also did some retopolgy in Maya, and I used Substance Painter for textures
